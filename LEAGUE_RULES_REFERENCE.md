# League-Friendly Rules Reference
## Applicable to Foul & Fortune

This document defines the league-friendly rules used by the app.
These rules are based on standard WPA/BCA logic but adapted for
self-officiated league and club play.

Core principles:
- No referee required
- Minimal judgment calls
- Consistent outcomes
- Familiar to most league players

Unless explicitly stated, standard pool fouls apply:
scratch, no rail contact, wrong first contact, ball off table.
Foul result is ball-in-hand unless a game section says otherwise.

### Fouls
- Ball-in-hand on all fouls.
- Cue ball fouls enforced.
- Object ball fouls ignored unless ball leaves the table.

### 8-Ball Conditions
- Early 8-ball: loss of game.
- Scratch on the 8-ball: loss of game.
- Legal pocket of the 8-ball wins immediately.

## 14.1 Straight Pool (Continuous)

### Objective
Reach the target score by pocketing any balls.
Each legally pocketed ball scores 1 point.

### Scoring Input (App)
You record how many object balls remain after your shot.
Points for the shot are the decrease in remaining balls.
If you clear the table, it is recorded as a Double Sack (15).

### Re-Rack Rule
- When exactly 1 object ball remains:
  - The other 14 balls are re-racked.
  - The remaining ball stays in position.
  - The inning continues.

### Break Shot
- Opening break must pocket a ball or drive two balls to a rail.
- Failure is a foul.

### Fouls
- Normal foul: -1 and ends the inning.
- Break foul: -2 and ends the inning.
- Ball-in-hand is not used in this mode.

### Three-Foul Rule
- Three consecutive fouls with 0 points scored in each inning triggers Three-Foul (TF).
- Mandatory warning after second foul (tracked by app).
- TF ends the inning and scores -16 for that inning (foul -1 plus additional -15).
- Over three fouls the total is -18.
- Balls are re-racked; opponent breaks.
- Notation: TF only.

### Shot Calling
- No called shots enforced.

## One Pocket (League-Friendly)

### Objective
Be the first player to legally pocket the required number of balls
(typically 8) into your assigned pocket.

### Pocket Assignment

### Scoring

### Fouls
- Ball-in-hand.
- Pocketing a ball into the opponent's pocket scores for them.
- Standard fouls apply.

### Spotting
- Balls pocketed on fouls are spotted on the foot spot if required.

## General Notes

self-scored competitive play.
