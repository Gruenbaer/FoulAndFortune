# Fortune 14/2 - Pool Scoring App

A Flutter-based pool scoring application for Fortune 14/2 billiards.

## 🎱 About

Fortune 14/2 is a scoring app designed for tracking pool games with custom rules, player statistics, achievements, and game history.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

This project uses **Puro** (Flutter version manager) instead of standard Flutter installation.

- **Flutter SDK**: Managed via Puro
- **Required Flutter Version**: 3.38.5 (stable)
- **Dart SDK**: 3.10.4

### Quick Start

1. **Install Puro** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Windows (via WinGet)
   winget install puro
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gruenbaer/141fortune
   cd 141fortune
   ```

3. **Set up Flutter environment**:
   ```bash
   puro use stable
   puro flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   puro flutter run
   ```

### Important: Using Puro

Since this project uses Puro, **always prefix Flutter commands with `puro`**:

| Standard Flutter | With Puro |
|-----------------|-----------|
| `flutter run` | `puro flutter run` |
| `flutter analyze` | `puro flutter analyze` |
| `flutter doctor` | `puro flutter doctor` |
| `flutter pub get` | `puro flutter pub get` |
| `flutter build apk` | `puro flutter build apk` |

### Build Commands

```bash
# Android APK
puro flutter build apk --release

# Check for issues
puro flutter analyze
puro flutter doctor
```

## 🤖 AI Development Note
